Header files hold declarations for use in other files
Header files typically only contain declarations

For example
#include <iostream>
includes the iostream.hpp file
This file only defines the declaration, not the function.
The function definition is defined in the C++ runtime support library.

If not for 
#include <iostream>
You would have to type in all the declarations iostream
in the main.cpp

HEADER FILES
header files have `header guard` which prevents a given header
file from being include more than once in the same file

Q: Why doesnt iostream have .h extension?
A: Because iostream.h is a different file from iostream

Compiling
g++ main.cpp add.cpp -o main

# if you have header files in an other directory, do this
g++ -o main -I /source/includes main.cpp
# use the -I option to specify an alternate include directory
