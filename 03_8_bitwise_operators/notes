Back in the day, computers had limited memory.

Even though a bool is just 1 or 0 and should take only
1 bit, it takes up 8 bytes.  The other 7 bits go to
waste.

Using bitwise operators, we can compact 8 booleans
into a single byte.

left shift    <<  x << y  all bits in x shifted left y bits
right shift   >>  x >> y  all bits in x shifted right y bits
bitwise NOT   ~   ~x      all bits in x flipped
bitwise AND   &   x & y   each bit in x AND each bit in y
bitwise OR    |   x | y   each bit in x OR each bit in y
bitwise XOR   ^   x ^ y   each bit in x XOR each bit in y
