A block of statements, also called a compound statement, 
is a group of statements that is treated by the compiler 
as if it were a single statement.

int add(int x, int y)
{ // start a block
    return x + y;
} // end a block
 
int main()
{ // start a block
 
    // multiple statements
    int value(0);
    add(3, 4);
 
    return 0;
 
} // end a block (no semicolon)
